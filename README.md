# Portfolio – Sanket Desai

A modern, minimalist portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and blog articles, inspired by Medium's clean reading experience.

## Purpose
This portfolio is designed to present my work, technical skills, and writing in a professional, recruiter-friendly format. It serves as a central hub for:
- Highlighting my best projects (with live demos and code)
- Sharing technical articles from my Medium blog
- Providing easy access to my contact and social links

## Features
- **Minimalist, Medium-inspired UI:** Clean, text-focused layout with ample whitespace and a monochrome palette accented by indigo.
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices, from desktop to mobile.
- **Live Projects Section:** Automatically displays my latest public GitHub repositories with descriptions, tech stack, and links to code/live demos.
- **Blog Integration:** Fetches and previews my latest Medium articles.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
- **Professional Footer:** Includes about, contact info, and social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, X/Twitter).
- **Subtle Animations:** Modern fade-ins and hover effects for a polished feel.

## How It Works
- **Built with React:** Uses Create React App for a fast, maintainable codebase.
- **Styled with styled-components:** Enables easy theming and responsive design.
- **GitHub API:** Fetches my latest public repositories for the Projects section.
- **Medium RSS Feed:** Integrates my Medium blog using the RSS feed and displays previews.
- **Deployed on Netlify:** Fast, reliable, and easy to update via GitHub.
